#  Resume Screening System - Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

This is the backend of the Resume Screening System built using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **pure TF-IDF-based NLP logic** (no external ML libraries). It enables recruiters to post jobs, 
job seekers to apply, and resumes to be matched with job descriptions based on semantic relevance.

##  Features

-  JWT-based user authentication (register/login)
-  Role-flexible system (any user can post jobs or apply)
-  Job posting with automatic TF-IDF vectorization
-  Resume uploading with text extraction (PDF/DOCX)
-  Resumeâ€“Job matching using TF-IDF & cosine similarity
-  Applicantsâ€™ data saved with match score
-  Recruiter dashboard (list own applicants and jobs)
-  Delete jobs with access control
-  Stored resume and job vectors for fast scoring
